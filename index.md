## Reach new audiences

Online courses take a big step forwards in the sharing of knowledge around the world. However, your course is only ever as good as the people it reaches. To help reach new audiences with online courses, P2PU developed learning circles: groups for people who take online courses together, in local libraries or community spaces.

Once you create a course, you can add it to P2PU’s learning circle [course page](http://p2pu.org/en/courses/), a growing database of online courses that people are using to facilitate learning circles around the world. You can also check out our [facilitator page](https://www.p2pu.org/en/facilitate/) to learn how to run your own learning circle.
